# How to run this

Ok so it's just a react app, go into frontend/frontend (lol I made a frontend folder and then created a react app not knowing it would make another folder for me. Now I'm scared to change it) and yarn/npm start

Then to run the JSON server open a second terminal and go into /data and npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

Once the database gets too cluttered with names you have to manually go in and remove all the items but leave the first one in.
